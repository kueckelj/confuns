\usage{
corr_dummy(diagonal, digits, distinct, type)
}
\arguments{
\item{diagonal}{Logical value.  Indicates if the diagonal values of the
matrices are kept ( = TRUE) or set to NA (= FALSE). Ignored if \code{type}
= \emph{'complete'}.}

\item{digits}{Numeric. Given to \code{base::round()} and indicates the number
of digits to which the correlation value is rounded. Defaults to 2.}

\item{distinct}{Logical value. If TRUE only one observation per variable pair remains
in the output data.frame. Ignored if \code{type} = \emph{'complete'}.}

\item{type}{Character value. Denotes how the underlying correlation matrix is
handled. Three options:

\itemize{
 \item{\emph{'complete'}:}{ The matrix stays as is.},
 \item{\emph{'lower'}:}{ The part below the diagonal is used. The upper part is set to NA.},
 \item{\emph{'upper'}:}{The part above the diagonal is used. the lower part is set to NA.}
 }}

\item{shape}{Character value. Specifies the shape of the geometric objects with
which the variable pairs are displayed. Either \emph{'circle', 'rect'} or \emph{'tile'}.}
